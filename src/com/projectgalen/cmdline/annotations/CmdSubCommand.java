 * "It can hardly be a coincidence that no language on Earth has ever produced the expression 'As pretty as an airport.'
 *  Airports are ugly. Some are very ugly. Some attain a degree of ugliness that can only be the result of special
 *  effort."
 * - Douglas Adams from "The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul"
